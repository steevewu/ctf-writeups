## Solution
Server give us unlimited encryption access, and any $m > p$ is denied, we can use binary search to recover $p$. $flag$ is also smaller than $p$, then $m \equiv c^d \mod{p}$, where $d \equiv e^{-1} \mod(p-1)$.    
I tried to solve this challenge after the competition sum up, so there is no $flag$.
