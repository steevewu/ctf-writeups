## Solution
In AES-CTR, the plaintext is XOR-ed with the keystream which is generated by encrypting `nonce` and `counter`, i.e: the first 16-byte block is XOR-ed with $Enc(nonce + 0)$, the second block is XOR-ed with $Enc(nonce + 1)$, and follow up.   
As the `counter` is increased after each 0.5s, we can easily recover all possible keystream by XOR-ing the first block with each iteration's ciphertext.    
The organisers given us that 'Greetings, Earthlings.' was the first parital of message, then we can slice its first 16-byte to recover the keystream.
