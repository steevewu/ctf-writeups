## Solution
This challenge is an instance of [Side channel attack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Side-channel_attack), particularly, a cryptanalysis aims to break confidentially, called [Power analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_analysis).       
The full introduction and implementation are described in [this blog](https://coastalwhite.github.io/intro-power-analysis/intro.html).      

The key recovery progress is presented in my attached [notebook](2025/craccon/powerplay/powerplay.ipynb).
